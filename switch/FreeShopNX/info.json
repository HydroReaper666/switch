Just go and hone your skills on a different level. * Laugh along with up to ten jokes! Look, we’re going to keep saying it's funny. You'll come around eventually. (Don’t worry there is no extra charge if you laugh more than ten times.)\n\n(No controllers were harmed in the making of this game.)",

        "intro": "A new challenger has appeared in the platform fighter arena! Brawlout is the party fighting game, designed for couch play, online matches and competitive tournaments. ",
        "description": "Brawlout packs a punch with couch and online play modes, blending platform fighter mechanics and traditional fighting game play into a stylish and fluid battle royale. Rather than slow-paced defensive battles, Brawlout goes all-out with the lightning-fast aerobatics which platform fighters are famous for. \n\nStriking the balance between the growing competitive scene and the genre’s party game roots, Brawlout hopes to cater to the veteran platform fighter, the casual fan and the newcomer looking to make their mark.\n\nEach character in Brawlout has their own unique playstyle, catering to specific character archetypes seen in other fighters. Whether you’re a die-hard grappler or a rushdown fiend, there is a fighter for you in Brawlout. There are currently six original characters and two popular indie characters to choose from that allow for varied play styles. As well as cosmetic skins, each original Brawlout character has three Variants alt versions of the character with different stats, outfits and even new moves. With these Variants, Brawlout’s cast numbers 18 individual fighters. Find the fighter and Variant that’s right for you and tear it up on the battlefield.\n\nCombined with familiar movement techniques like wavedashing and airdodging, Brawlout adds some extra mechanics seen in other fighting games. The Rage Meter builds up as you both deal and take damage, allowing you either break combos with the Rage Burst or unleash hell with the Rage Mode. The Rage Burst pushes opponents back, breaking their combos and allowing players to create some breathing room at the cost of half their Rage Meter. If the meter fills, you can activate the Rage Mode, increasing the knockback you deal while reducing the amount you take.\n\n\nAs for modes, Brawlout has all you’d expect from a normal platform fighter and then some. Up to four players can compete in either timed, stock or team battles: -\tAll on the same device -\tEach with their own device, without any internet connection, playing nearby -\tOnline either with friends or other Brawlout players AI opponents are also available if you want to practice your team combos with a friend, or if you need to fill out a free for all. Train with Advanced Tutorials or go in for yourself in challenging Arcade Towers.",

Tough but fair combat, responsive controls, challenging foes, permadeath and of course, the emergency panic roll to get you out of trouble, make for a demanding, visceral and cathartic action game. \n\nExperience a Roguevania, mixing an interconnected world, branching paths and unlockable skills with the constant adrenaline-pumping threat of permadeath. No checkpoints. You either vanquish the final boss in one go, or you try again. However, you keep some of your progress for successive runs new paths you’ve unlocked, access to new levels, mutations, abilities and weapons.\n\nSpeaking of weapons, Dead Cells features a plethora of ways to slay your enemies. A large variety of swords, bows and of course spells, but also whips, grenades and turrets, each one with its own unique twist. Plus, mutations and scrolls allow you to build and customize your character differently with each and every run.\n\nAt the end of the day though, it’s YOUR skills as a player that matter most! Roguelites are about constantly sharpening your skills, until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in the park. Patience, you’ll get better!… eventually.\n\nFeatures:\n\nRogueVania: The progressive exploration of an interconnected world, with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath.\n\n2D Souls-lite Action: Tough but fair combat, the iconic dodge roll, more than 90 weapons and spells with unique gameplay… The unforgiving action wed to the absence of any kind of safety net makes for an adrenalin pumping ride each and every run. \n\nNonlinear progression: Sewers, Ossuary or Ramparts? Once unlocked, special permanent abilities allow you to access new paths to reach your objective. Opt for the path that suits your current build, your play style, or just your mood.\n\nExploration: Secret rooms, hidden passages, charming landscapes.

The second is a pandemic that has turned humans into “the Dissolved,” infected beings with special cognitive powers whose sick bodies will eventually dissolve into blood. If Michael doesn’t hurry, he won’t be able to avoid the impending moment of “dead synchronicity” when Time itself starts to dissolve.\n\nAs players, you’re going to find space-time distortions, concentration camps, supernatural phenomena, gruesome deaths, hard-to-solve puzzles and, all in all, a bloodstained challenge!",

Yet he has managed to always stay one step ahead. \n\nShe hoped to bring an end to the chase in the redwood forests of Northern California. But like so many times before, the trail went cold...\n\nThen she encountered an abandoned camper in the middle of the highway. Enormous claw marks scored the roof and the lost family’s personal belongings were scattered everywhere. All signs pointed to the scene being fresh. \n\nAnd all clues led into nearby Ravenwood Park...\n\nWalking through the park gates, the detective feels the weight of invisible eyes watching. Sinister shadows lurk behind the park’s enchanting scenery and the wary glances of its overly-polite employees. Is this place connected to Maple Creek, and the preacher? \n\nWho is the mysterious prisoner she meets on the forest path – someone stalking her every move, or a possible ally? Is she merely a puppet being used in forces from outside our world, or will she finally resolve the evil events that began one year before?",

Select a hero [or team up in co-op] and battle your way to the bottom of the Gungeon by surviving a challenging and evolving series of floors filled with the dangerously adorable Gundead and fearsome Gungeon bosses armed to the teeth. Gather precious loot, discover hidden secrets, and chat with opportunistic merchants and shopkeepers to purchase powerful items to gain an edge.\n\nThe Gungeon: Enter the Gungeon – a constantly evolving bullet hell fortress that elegantly blends meticulously hand-designed rooms within a procedurally-generated labyrinth bent on destroying all that enter its walls. But beware – the Gungeon responds to even the most modest victory against its sentries and traps by raising the stakes and the challenges found within! \n\nThe Cult of the Gundead: The Gungeon isn’t just traps and chasms – calm your nerves and steady your aim as you face down the gun-totting Cult of the Gundead. These disciples of the gun will stop at nothing to put down the heroes in their tracks and employ any tactics necessary to defend their temple.\n\nThe Gungeoneers: Choose between one of several unlikely heroes, each burdened by a deep regret and in search of a way to change their past, no matter the cost. Filled with equal parts courage and desperation, these adventurers won’t hesitate to dive across flaming walls, roll through a wall of bullets, or take cover behind whatever is around to make it to their goal alive!\n\nThe Guns: Discover and unlock scores of uniquely fantastic guns to annihilate all that oppose you in the Gungeon – each carrying their own unique tactics and ammunition. Unleash everything from the tried and true medley of missiles, lasers, and cannonballs to the bizarrely effective volley of rainbows, fish, foam darts, and bees! Yep, bees.",

        "description": "FRUITFALL CRUSH, a true puzzle game, ideally suited to the Nintendo Switch™ gaming philosophy simple in concept but with enormous depth as the challenge increases. FruitFall Crush is very easy to grasp with simple controls but will keep players coming back for more, eager to improve their performance. It’s one of those games that’s impossible to put down, yet so easy to pick up and play! The superb blend of carefully crafted game mechanics, ease of play combined with 75 mind bending levels, will have you reaching for FruitFall Crush time and time again!\n\nIT’S A BRAIN GAME! The objective of the game is to make the fruit disappear by moving them around the grid until they are grouped together – fruit must be either above or to the left or right of another fruit, diagonals do not count. The fruit can be moved by rotating the play area and allowing the fruit to fall thereby creating groups of three or more of the same fruit, which will then be removed, a bonus is awarded if more than one group disappears on one turn. FruitFall Crush provides the player with 4 great Game Modes to enhance the playing experience to the full.\n\nARCADE MODE: In this mode you attempt to complete as many levels in a row accumulating your time and score as you proceed. If you run out of time or fail on any particular level, you are given three ‘continues’ - displayed as hearts at the top left of the screen. An Auto-solve help system avoids you becoming trapped and frustrated. Once you have ‘unlocked’ (completed) a level within Arcade mode, you are then allowed to access it within Time Trial or Practice modes.\n\nTIME TRIAL MODE: Finish the game as quickly as you can! You can try any ‘unlocked’ level as many times as you like, recording your best times along with your name for that level.\n\nPRACTICE MODE: Play the game at your own speed, no ticking clock to worry about and each time you restart, you continue where you got to last time.\n\nTWO PLAYER MODE: Go head-to-head with a friend in the exciting 2 player mode, using one Switch console either side by side in TV mode or competing end to end using a Joy-Con each to see who can finish 10 levels the quickest?!

The various weapons can be found or purchased (depending on the game mode) and each one has its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nGHOST: The protagonist is not the android you see, but the being that remotely controls it: a mysterious digital ghost that can leave its robot chassis, pass through doors and walls, control enemy androids, and use their own tools against them. What happens if the robot you control gets destroyed, you ask? Then your ghost will be free to control something else, or return to your main body.\n\nUPGRADES: You can have as many as you can collect. The upgrades are passive, so they work without needing any special controls, and they don't run out or deactivate. They come in a large assortment, from aggressive drones to bullet improvements. Remember that the more you get, the more OP you are.\n\nITEMS: Devices you can use at any time. High-tech equivalents to potions and scrolls.\n\nGEEKIES: Spread throughout the game are hidden \"geekies\". If you find one and activate it, something related to that geekie will change in the game (not affecting gameplay)... and the challenge is to find out what changes. I know, it sounds silly, but some of them are funny.\n\nSECRETS: 200 rooms have secrets in them that can be revealed by performing a specific action. If you find a secret, you're rewarded with a small permanent powerup that will make your character more powerful. In addition, finding all of the secrets in each level will reward you with something very special.\n\nMAP: The whole map has around 300 rooms, divided into zones. Each zone has its own enemies, its own ambience, its own soundtrack, and, of course, its own boss.\n\nSTORY: The story is not to save the world, but rather to go on an intruiging journey wrought with humor. Not to mention all the dialogues and cinematics, all voiced in English.\n\nGAME MODES: Ghost has 2 game modes: \"classic\" and \"survival\". Classic is similar to a metroidvania, where the more you advance through the game, the more stuff you obtain and the harder the enemies become. Survival is crazier, as you get stuff much faster and you'll soon turn into a killing machine, but you lose everything when you die.\n\nSKILL TREE: The RPG component of the game is found in the skill tree, where you can spend skill points to level up characters, obtaining special skills for each one. Depending on what skills you select, your gameplay will change in an interesting way.\n\nAnd the rest is a mystery, one that I shouldn't spoil... you'll just have to discover the rest on your own.",

You play as Heart, a sentient robot fighting to escape the grip of the evil and all seeing machine QuAsSy (Quality Assurance Systems). But make no mistake, Heart&Slash is no walk in the park. Every death is permanent and means a new randomly generated level for you to start over with a different set of weapons and items you can use, new enemies to fight and secrets to explore. Heart&Slash offers players something new and challenging because it is not about mastering one system, rather adapting to what is provided and making the most of it.",

Something deep in my brain – deep in my very soul – clawed at me, struggling to make sense of everything. But the sad truth is that it never could. I never could. I still can’t remember who I am.”\n\nHello, prospective crew member! Welcome to Shakhter-One, the first space mining ship to gather resources from the atmosphere of the planet Jupiter! Shakhter-One provides mass quantities of supplies to a resource-starved Earth. Thanks to Shakhter-One, we no longer have to depend on coal or oil! Still not sold on making Shakhter-One your new home?\n\n“I don’t even know if this has happened before. Me, here, telling this same, exact story. …Surely not. I would remember that… Right?”\n\nShakhter-One offers a fresh start among the stars! On Shakhter-One, everybody is important! Everybody is employed! All children have an equal start! We’re confident you’ll see that Shakhter-One is the perfect place to begin your family’s future!\n\n“The only thing that I can truly be sure of is the constant, pervading feeling I have deep inside. I’m empty. I’m hollow.”\n\nIn “Hollow,” you are one of the pilots that transports precious resource cargo from the mining ship Shakhter-One down to Earth. One day you wake up in an emergency capsule drifting near the facility. You don’t remember who you are, or how you got out there… All you can remember is an autopilot docking code for capsule dock NR 6.\n\nWhen you dock with Shakhter-One, it is clear that something has gone horribly wrong. The crew is missing and the entire facility is dealing with catastrophic power issues. As you start to uncover the ship’s terrifying secrets, Shakhter-One threatens to take your identity, your sanity, and – ultimately – your life.\n\nThe worst evil is the one that knows us better than we know ourselves. The worst nightmare is the one borne in our past, emotions, fears, and pain.",

You can even set up games with a mix of local and online players to fit your needs. The full single-player and local-multiplayer experience can also be played while waiting for a match online!\n\nIn VERSUS mode, up to four players can compete across thirty-nine different maps in 1v1 or 2v2 battles. Head straight into online ranked multiplayer, train against five tiers of AI bots, or customize the rules in local games and private online lobbies.\n\nTake on the challenge of ARCADE mode alone or with a friend as you fight for survival on eleven stages. Create devastating chain attacks through the enemy swarms as you compete for high scores on the global leaderboards!",

That is, until you turned up to ruin the party. As part of a secret and mysterious society whose members have sworn to rid the world of these Bad Guys, it’s your responsibility to make sure justice is served in the bloodiest possible way, using your unpredictability to your advantage.\n\nTrack the Bad Guys, be brutal and smart in your planning, and eliminate them one by one. But bear this in mind: each criminal’s death has to look like an accident. In each level, you’ll have the chance to splatter and destroy the Bad Guy using various weapons and traps. It’s up to you to make sure he ends up in the wrong place at the right time.\n\nIn this ingenious puzzle game in which physics plays an essential role, you’ll need to keep a cool head and your wits about you. Show no mercy as you set out to kill the Bad Guy! “Until your mission is accomplished we don’t exist. If you fail, you’ll be the only person at fault, and we’ll deny ever knowing you.”\n\nFeatures TRACK YOUR TARGET in 60 levels, each one more original than the last, and unlock 6 completely off-the-wall bonus levels. USE YOUR IMAGINATION as you take out the criminals one by one. Find the opportune moment to act, and make it as bloody as you can! BECOME THE AMBASSADOR OF DEATH and make full use of all the different traps available. Sabotage vehicles, transform daily objects into deadly weapons, or combine different elements in order to create new ones. WORK IN THE SHADOWS. Don’t draw attention to yourself. Cameras, pedestrians, cops and the Bad Guys’ bodyguards mustn’t suspect you. No one should ever doubt that these deaths are anything but unfortunate accidents. TRY, TRY AND TRY AGAIN as you take advantage of the game’s replay feature. Get the top score, fulfil the secondary objectives, find new ways to kill each Bad Guy, and work on your murder skills. SHOW OFF your killing prowess and achievements to your friends, and prove that you are the world’s top justice seeker.",

Travel to the New Lands and welcome the deluge of new mounts, merchants, and vagrants that call these isles home, but be wary of the new obstacles that threaten your arrival -- for not just the greedy creatures block your way but even the environment itself can defeat you.\n\nKingdom: New Lands asks you to puzzle things out on your own. You'll come across items, NPCs, and mysterious statues to help you but you'll have to figure out just how exactly they'll aide you in building and defending your Kingdom.\n\nKingdom: New Lands features: ● One ruler, their horse, and a bag of coins ● Greedy creatures trying to take your coins and crown every night (stop them!) ● Loyal subjects who will help build, attack and defend your Kingdom ● Multiple upgrades for your homestead, different unit types to attack and defend, and secrets littered throughout the land ● Beautiful soundtrack that has received two honorable mentions from the Independent Games Festival\n\nBe brave, ruler, and fight to the bitter end, lest these New Lands conquer you instead.",

Eliminate the criminal underworld of the city’s three major districts and persuade undecided voters to your cause, tackling the issues that matter by putting a gun in the mouth of those issues. \n\nThrough the power of ISO-Slant™ technology and a wasted youth, London-based developer Roll7 (OlliOlli) delivers the greatest 2¼D cover-based indie shooter of all-time, ever.\n\nNext Level Shootouts – Use reasonable force unreasonably in a dynamic mix of run-and-gun gameplay and cover-based shootouts. The intuitive quick-snap cover system lets you slide, roll, and dive into cover, dodging enemy fire before fighting back with tackles, executions, and 100s of bullets.\n\nRoster of Not Heroes - Select between 9 different heroes, each with their own distinct gameplay style and crime murdering abilities. Blast the city’s scum through doors with Cletus’ a shotgun, slice them in half with Kimmy’s katana dash, or simply bash crime in it’s terrible face with Ronald’s hammer.\n\nDynamic Missions – Go ham on primary objectives and (sometimes random) secondary goals but be prepared for unexpected mid-level events that turn the tables on the anti-heroes in an instant. SWAT teams, gun-toting elderly, helicopter gunships, pandas, pugs and suicidal samurais stand between you and victory.",

        "description": "In the remote mountains of Colorado, horrors wait inside Mount Massive Asylum. A long-abandoned home for the mentally ill, recently re-opened by the “research and charity” branch of the transnational Murkoff Corporation, the asylum has been operating in strict secrecy… until now. Acting on a tip from an anonymous source, independent journalist Miles Upshur breaks into the facility, and what he discovers walks a terrifying line between science and religion, nature and something else entirely. Once inside, his only hope of escape lies with the terrible truth at the heart of Mount Massive.\n\nContinue to explore the dark world of the Murkoff Corporation with the included Outlast: Whistleblower DLC. You will play as Waylon Park, a software engineer under contract with Murkoff and the man who emailed journalists around the world - including Miles - at the beginning of Outlast. Spending a couple of weeks at Mount Massive, during which he was unable to even talk to his wife and son thanks to strict security protocols, Waylon developed a deep-seated distrust of the profit-motivated scientists and doctors leading dangerous and irresponsible experiments on their patients. Identifying with those poor souls fueled Waylon's anger, and set the stage for his unmasking of Mount Massive's rotten core. Although Whistleblower tells the story that led to Outlast, it will actually stretch past the events of the first game to show the final chapter in Mount Massive Asylum's story.\n\nOutlast: Bundle of Terror is a true survival horror experience which aims to show that the most terrifying monsters of all come from the human mind. \n\nFeatures:\n\n- True Survival Horror Experience: You are no fighter - if you want to survive the horrors of the asylum, your only chance is to run... or hide - Immersive Graphics: AAA-quality graphics give players a detailed, terrifying world to explore - Hide and Sneak: Stealth-based gameplay, with parkour-inspired platforming elements - Unpredictable Enemies: Players cannot know when - and from where - one of the asylum’s terrifying inhabitants will finally catch up to them - Real Horror: Outlast’s setting and characters are inspired by real asylums and cases of criminal insanity ",

Creating sound illuminates your environment, but also agitates the house and the entities within. Use Cassie’s Delphi text-to-speech app along with her intuition to uncover the mansion’s history. Each time a mystery is solved, the mansion transforms to reflect the fate of a different generation and the torment they endured.\n\nStory:\n\nPlay as Cassie, a young blind woman set on being independent despite the dangers she faces in her search to discover the truth. After months of research, she finds a connection to an abandoned mansion in Gloucester, Massachusetts.

The former inhabitants call out to Cassie from inside Echo Bluff’s walls, but to solve her own mystery, she must first uncover theirs.\n\nGame Features:\n\n\"See\" using echolocation. Every sound creates a visual.\n\nUncover the truth that has affected the estate across centuries.

Travel from the safe refuge of your farm through a series of regions progressively more affected by the infernal plague.\n\nOn the road, rescue survivors and choose whether to use them as traveling companions or to improve the Doctor's farm and gain access to new abilities. How your farm progresses depends upon where you assign survivors to work.\n\nSome survivor types are more valuable in certain jobs, but may be more useful still if kept available for expeditions. Surviving the road will rely on your ability to fight horrors created by the plague, in combat encounters featuring grid-based positioning and turn-based strategy mechanics.",

Multiple control modes supported, including two players on a single Nintendo Switch™, using a single Joy-Con™ per player. -Panic Mode pits your pool skills against the clock, but don't forget that all the other balls are just as animated and alive as you, so different balls react differently to hits! -Discover the unique characteristics of dozens of different balls and the strategies required to pot them, even as they use their unique skills to try and thwart your efforts. -Fight a swamp monster, light up a derelict lighthouse, battle a biker gang, puke on a pirate ship, flee zombieballs after raising the dead, foil a bank heist, even joust! Seriously, you can ride a horse ball and joust. -Express yourself! White cue balls such as yourself can use a little pizzazz, so enjoy trying on the 80+ different hats you're able to steal from other balls in the game.",

        "description": "Teleport yourself into the most hardcore game this fall. Try to imagine a game simple in its basics, but demanding from the very first level, where everything might kill you. Even the camera and the main protagonist are against you as both of them constantly move forward. Add some barbed wire, spikes, and sawblades and you'll get Red Game Without a Great Name. And in this game you will die a lot.\n\nGameplay You control a mechanical bird that serves as a messenger in a hostile, steampunk world. To get the letter from one cage to another you have to maneuver the bird between all the obstacles. However, you don’t directly control the main hero. The bird moves at its own pace, as does the camera. The trick is you can only order the bird to teleport from one point to another by clicking on it and dragging to mark its destination. \n\nDon’t worry about frustrations though (not too much at least), you won’t notice loading screens between the restarts, and the swinging music, as well as the one-more-try syndrome will keep you playing until you complete all of the 60 cleverly designed levels. There are three different power-ups to help you out in your mailman duties, but beware, they may work as double-edged swords if used without caution.\n\nKey Features - Simple to grasp, hard to master game mechanic – click & drag to teleport - 60 difficult levels - 180 gears to collect - 3 power-ups to enhance your abilities. - Unique art style dominated by red - One more attempt syndrome - Swinging music",

Without it, you'd fail even harder. - Epic Storyline: Not included. Instead, be guided by floor texts that make fun of you when you fail and drop awful puns even if you unexpectedly don't. - Scavenger Hunt: Discover secret areas that lead to other secret areas which in turn lead to other secret areas. You get the idea, and maybe even the rainbow that awaits you at the end of the treasure. Probably you'll just google it though. - Speedrolling: Replay levels in Rush mode as fast as you can and prove that you are a good person by beating other players' highscores. - Style your Balls: Be rewarded with awesome bonus contents like tasty new colors and trail effects for your balls.",

        "description": "Semblance is a innovative platformer with deformable terrain, set in a beautiful minimalist world. It’s a game that asks, what if you could deform and reshape the world itself? Semblance takes the idea of a ‘platform’ in a platformer and turns it on it’s head. What if platforms were actually part of the gameplay, part of the way you solved problems? Explore a world where the default is soft, where the property of 'hardness' doesn't exist. Each of the game's three worlds explore a new consequence of a planet that can shift, change and deform. Beat back the strange, crystalline infection of hard material by freeing the world's life essences and uncover the dark cause for its appearance.\n\nUnique and innovative deforming platform gameplay: Can’t reach a collectible? Just deform and elevate a piece of the ground so that the point you jump from is higher. Nasty spikes in the way? Just deform and push-down the ground lower so that you can pass by. Squish, bounce, squash and transform the world- and yourself to solve problems.\n\n\nBeautiful Minimalist Aesthetic Design: Explore 3 worlds bursting with colorful minimalist charm, quirky critters, and calming vistas. Become hypnotized by each world's dynamically layered score, each with a hint of African aural distinction.\n\nExplore non-linearly: The game allows you to move between puzzles as you wish, never forcing you to find a solution in order to progress and enabling you to come back later. Similarly, the game's narrative is presented expansively, allowing you to explore- and piece together the story for yourself as you roam the game.",

Now we’re not saying that “Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn” is better than the Good Book that would be blasphemy. But please consider the following questions: ●\tDoes the Bible feature BASKETBALL LEGEND SHAQUILLE O’NEAL AS AN ASS-KICKING WU XING MASTER? ●\tCan the Holy Writ boast A DOPE RAP FEATURING THE BIG ARISTOTLE HIMSELF? ●\tDoes the Book of Books provide the EXCITEMENT AND HILARITY OF BATTLING BOSSES WHO ARE PARODIES OF FAMOUS DOUCHEBAGS? ●\tDo any of the conflicts depicted in The Sacred Testimony qualify as EPIC BOSS BATTLES THAT YOU WON’T BELIEVE WE ACTUALLY PUT INTO A GAME? “Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn” DOES contain all of those thrilling features and many more!",

And if 300+ single player levels weren't enough SMB also throws in epic boss fights, tons of unlockable secrets, warp zones and hidden characters.\n\nAnd now coming first to Nintendo Switch™ is a brand new way to play Super Meat Boy with your friends. Introducing \"RACE MODE\"! In this 2 player split screen race, friends (or enemies) can compete against each other through individual chapters, randomized levels, or the entire game!

Explore the mystical forests of Treevale, hike the haunted craters of the moon and dive into the depths of the ocean to find the lost city of Crablantis. \n\nIt's a mixture of lovingly handcrafted action-platforming levels, and RPG-like locations with townsfolk who provide quests, items and other goodies for you to buy to aid you on your journey. Just like your favorite peanut butter and jelly sandwich, The Adventure pals is both nutty and sweet,with perhaps just a little crunch.

        "description": "Ever miss being a child, playing games at your grandma's or in your old bedroom? Then look no further! The Adventures of Elena Temple is the classic you never knew existed. And the best part is that you can play it on virtual old machines that kind of sort of maybe existed. It's not like you can remember for sure anyway, right?\n\nThe game is a monochromatic puzzle platformer made to look as if it were created in the 80s. Overcome obstacles, figure out how to collect all the coins, find all the gems and remember your childhood while doing it! Progress through the game's dungeon through non-linear exploration and keep an open eye for secrets to find.                     Features: - A dungeon of 50+ rooms to overcome, each its own mini-level - Open exploration, choose which way to go, but don't worry, a helpful map is just one button press away - Challenging, old-school platforming - Collect as many coins as you want, but we both know you want them all - Coins will make you rich, but there's no escaping the dungeon without all the gems - Secret scrolls to find for the more observant player - Best of all, play the game on a selection of 7 virtual old machines, from the Pomo D'or 4, to Maple and Some Toy and all the way to the NS-Bos PC\n\nHeads up! The Adventures of Elena Temple is just one game you can play on seven simulated machines. Aside from the different look, the game plays the same on all machines and has the exact same content! The purpose of these old machines is to remind you of the old days, so feel free to pick whichever you like best without any fear of missing out on game content.\n\nI'm a solo indie developer, I loved making The Adventures of Elena Temple and I hope you enjoy it! Thank you for your support!",

Hans walked into the forest in search of adventure. Soon it was night and the boy was really scared, so he tried to go back.

This is The Final Station.\n\nThe real question is whether or not you'll help the survivors get to their destinations.... or let them die and loot their bodies. Sometimes people can be more trouble than they're worth. \n\n- A post-apocalyptic adventure about travelling a dying world on a train - A story that goes through 5 chapters, with large inhabited stations at the end of each one. - Infected are ready to stop your progress whenever you exit the train to look for supplies - Maintain your train in operating condition and craft valuable items from the resources you scavenge - Don't expect to shoot your way through the crowds of infected. Supplies and ammo are very limited - Pick up survivors along the way, gaining perks (and hindrances) for your troubles - Scavenge for loot at stations and craft useful supplies - Sell your loot at inhabited stations for useful upgrades to your weapons",

In secret, they fill the roly-poly world with light and life. But when their existence is discovered, they become hunted. Emil, a trader for odds and ends, made all the Asposians believe that the dynasty is in cahoots with dark forces. The only one who can stop the evil Emil is the heir to the throne: Robert. He has been petrified for three years, though. With a huge dose of enthusiasm, but little to no idea what he’s actually doing, he embarks on an adventure to find the legendary last wind monk. Of course, he has some great company: Peck, as loyal as he is flightless, and Laura, a rebel who certainly does fly, but only off the handle - and who Robert loves, with a capital L. Everything changes, when they meet the mysterious Mama Dola, who seems to know more about Robert's destiny than Robert would like.",

At first, Daniel believed that he was having a massive hallucination. Eager to keep playing within the RPG to create his own adventure, he decides to go along for te ride until his delirium comes to an end. Once inside the castle, Daniel is inhabited by a mysterious shadow. This dark spirit can communicate with Daniel, but not control him. The shadow has a simple goal: to escape from the prison of Daniel's body. There's a catch, though-- the dark spirit can only escape if Daniel perishes. Struggling against enemies in the castle, with the dark spirit attempting to murder him at every turn. Daniel finally discovers his goal: to kill Harnakon, the master of the castle, and free the Pure-Spirits who are trapped within. While the stage seems set for a typical role-playing adventure, Daniel will soon discover that everything is not what it seems...",

The survivors faired rather poorly in the immediate aftermath, becoming prey to all manner of predator. However, a lucky few managed to survive even then, to adapt, to thrive, to evolve. Zombillie was one such creature.\n\nZombillie lived a comfortable life in his humble cave, hunting for meat, and as he hunted, he grew, and grew, and grew. Everything was going relatively well for Zombillie, except for one problem: Zombillie didn't have enough meat!\n\nHelp Zombillie reach the legendary meat farm! A long road lies ahead: 90 complex levels full of puzzles and traps. So stand on your feet - all 100 of them - and just ride!\n\nFeatures - Almost 100 challenging levels - 3 completely different environments - Lots of power-ups & gadgets to find - Various levels - 2 additional types of mini-games - Addictive gameplay",

Along with earning more money and becoming an infamous criminal comes new customization that lets players build and alter their guns and gear.\n\nPAYDAY 2 comes with full touch screen menu support, and a newly developed rumble feature that responds as you, for example, fire weapons or throw grenades. There’s also an added local multiplayer mode to the CRIME.NET - called CRIME.NET Local Play, that will make you able to set up a local game and invite friends that share the same local network. Finally, PAYDAY 2 comes with an exclusive character called Joy who’s initially releasing only on Nintendo Switch™ - complete with her own mask and weapons.\n\n■ Rob Banks, Get Paid – Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side.\n\n■ CRIME.NET – The dynamic contract database CRIME.NET lets players pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local Contractors - all with their own agenda and best interests in mind.\n\n■ Dynamic Scenarios – No heist ever plays out the same way twice, as heists come with random geometry and events.\n\n■ Choose Your Skills – As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master.\n\n■ More Masks than Ever – PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask together with a pattern and a color.\n\n■ Weapons and Modifications – A huge arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper to assault rifles. You can modify your weapon with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and lots more.\n\n■ Play It Your Way – Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes, to running in guns blazing.",

        "description": "The planet Avalice has long known a tenuous peace thanks to the Kingdom Stone: an orb of unknown origin that outputs enough free energy to power every device in the world, seemingly without limit. The Kingdom Stone is beginning to weaken, however, and the planet’s three ruling houses are poised to engage in all-out war over control of this most precious resource. Add to that a coup d’etat within one of these houses – instigated by an invading alien army – and Avalice’s future is looking grim. Enter, our three unlikely protagonists: the dragon, Sash Lilac, who unwittingly gets involved when she witnesses a strange airship crash-land and grows concerned for the well-being of its pilot the wildcat, Carol Tea, whose dedication to her best friend leads her to undertake whatever challenges fate throws her way and the orphaned puppy, Milla Basset, whose quest for nothing more than mere companionship inadvertently brings her directly into the line of fire. Together, this trio of anthropomorphized heroines must somehow ingratiate themselves to each of the three houses, stop an all-out alien invasion, and learn the secret nature of the Kingdom Stone before its power wanes…and before a world war breaks out around them.  Freedom Planet is a fast-paced combat-driven platform adventure that pits a spunky dragon girl and her friends against hostile foreign powers and alien attack forces. There's trouble around every turn, from insects to giant robots to sheer explosive destruction, but players will have a variety of special fighting abilities at their disposal to blast through more than a dozen massive, nonlinear stages. The campaign may be played through as Lilac, Carol, or the unlockable Milla, each of whom has completely unique gameplay mechanics, an altered story mode in which the selected character takes the lead, and even a few of her own unique stages.  KEY FEATURES  Gorgeous 2D pixel art with meticulous detail and a grand, rocking soundtrack Lush multi-scrolling backdrops are layered behind minutely detailed stages, each populated with a variety of lovingly animated characters and most backed by at least two unique music tracks per stage, along with unique music for almost every boss battle.  Three playable characters with completely different strengths and abilities Use Lilac’s dragon powers to hair-whip enemies, spin like a cyclone, or blaze through the skies like a comet use Carol’s feline agility to cut through foes with punches and kicks, scale walls, or summon a gravity-defying motorcycle and use Milla’s mighty basset-hound ears to fly short distances, or call upon her canine magic to create deadly cubes which can be tossed at foes, compressed into a directional shield, or fired off as if from a rifle.  Momentum-based platforming and combat in a wide variety of settings Use the game’s tight controls to reach incredible speeds and heights, exploring massive stages full of secrets, alternate paths, and hidden collectibles. Send enemies flying, fight screen-filling bosses, dodge lasers, ride mine carts, hop from airship to airship, and more!  Follow the story, or just play the game it’s all up to you Play in “Adventure Mode” to enjoy the game’s intense and dramatic story, with over an hour of unique cutscenes and full voice-acting, or pick “Classic Mode” to do away with cutscenes entirely and simply play the stages for a streamlined gameplay experience.",

The main difficulty is to understand what you have to do in order to get asylum. You've come from an foreign land in the south and find yourself lost and confused - a confusion you convey through letters to your sister back home. An important part of the gameplay, these letters help you understand your tasks while at the same time moving the narrative of the game forward.",

Governments and companies promise remedies through technological progress. Drones and humanoid robots replace humans in the public sector, everything is interconnected, surveillance has become omnipresent.\n\nRichard Nolan is one of the few journalists openly criticizing this development. When he wakes up in hospital after an explosion and finds that his wife and son have mysteriously vanished, Richard realizes: he and his family have become more than just bystanders in a storm of rivaling ideas pertaining humankind’s salvation between dystopian reality and digital utopia. Instead, they find themselves right at the center of it.\n\nThis domestic drama evolves into a thriller about a worldwide conspiracy, which at its core aims to determine the fate of humanity: Could a perfect digital utopia be the answer? A virtual paradise not affected by material needs and quarrels? Could a super-AI be our savior – or would it simply declare us as dispensable since it could not be taught the value of philanthropy?\n\nWhat will the world look like after this storm, what will remain of humanity?\n\n· Experience an alarmingly realistic vision of the near future · Dive into a multi-layered Sci-Fi thriller, where dystopian reality and digital utopia are intertwined · Unravel a global conspiracy in a society of ubiquitous digitalism, surveillance and transhumanism · Explore a world with a rich and unique visual style, combining realistic environments with low-poly characters · Take on the role of journalist Richard Nolan, as well as five additional playable characters · Use dexterity, deductional skill and research to reconstruct Richard's past",

They boasted an estate of four hectares where the rich landowner Mr. Benjamin Hudson owned a large number of slaves from the African continent, whom he tortured and raped in numerous occasions, provoking death. The case never reached the courts since Hudson enjoyed great freedom thanks to the contacts he had previously obtained in political office. Because of this, the journalist James O'Connell must travel to the state of Louisiana, where a difficult task awaits him if he intends to bring to light all the mysteries that may have been hidden for more than a hundred years in that mansion.\n\n\nWill you be able to solve the Hudson family’s best kept secret?\n\nTry with this incredible Point and Click!\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Based on the Point and Click games - Great graphics that will immerse you in the story - Lots of items to collect and puzzles to solve - An incredible soundtrack - Self-saved - HD graphics - All items tagged - NO hidden objects - Track book - Translated into: Spanish, English, Italian, French, Japanese",

In order to return back to their village through the power of the treasure, they decided to face the challenges of the dungeon!\n\nIf Rose is defeated during the adventure, she will lose all items and her level will be reset. And because the dungeon transforms every time you challenge it, the quests will never be the same. Your courage and growth will be the key to clear the dungeon!\n\nFeatures:\n\nOne choice, one victory: This game is turn-based. Both Rose and the enemies take turns moving. Players can think about what to do on their next turn. Wisdom and courage will bring you “small victories”, and these will eventually bring you “huge victories”. \n\nThe \"Fang\" system: Rose can wear Fangs of monsters and gain their abilities. There are more than 200 kinds of monsters. You can seek the strongest combination and arrange your Fangs however you like.\n\nThe \"Brave\" system: Rose powers up when there are no obstacles around you within 8 squares.

        "description": "CASTLE OF HEART, available exclusively for Nintendo Switch™, is a classic action platformer at the genre’s best... and most challenging, with plentiful of new twists on formula to experience. The players take control over a cursed knight, turned to stone by the evil sorcerer’s spell, but ready to prove that love and courage can conquer even the darkest magic.\n\nThe brave hero must travel all the way from the petrified village to the dark ruler’s castle, mastering 20 levels set in 4 distinct environments – full of enemies who require different strategies to face them successfully and sudden gameplay changes, which translate to exciting, dynamic action sequences. The selection of progressively more powerful additional weapons, from flaming grenades to powerful magical arsenal, as well as power-ups, will help him in his quest. But remember – the body of stone has its limits! It disintegrates permanently as the knight loses the energy, which he can supply only by defeating his enemies, and if the process reaches the critical level, he may lose one of his arms and the ability to wield additional weapons with it. \n\nCastle of Heart offers beautiful and detailed 3D graphics with changing landscape, weather conditions and rich backgrounds. The game’s aesthetics and bestiary are in equal parts inspired by the Slavic mythology – with some locations derived straight from famous, mystical locations in Poland, the developers’ home country – and the dark fantasy atmosphere of the best action platformer titles from the golden age of the genre. All of this makes Castle of Heart a perfect mix of classic influences and modern approach, utilizing the spectrum of Nintendo Switch™ features, which will enchant both fans of the genre and newcomers.",

As you rise to take your father’s place as ruler, it will fall to you to stage your defences. But make no mistake – this is no fight for victory, but a desperate grasp for survival.  Bad North is a charming but brutal real-time tactics roguelite. Defend your idyllic island kingdom against a horde of Viking invaders, as you lead the desperate exodus of your people. Command your loyal subjects to take full tactical advantage of the unique shape of each island. Everything is at stake: fail, and watch the blood of your subjects stain the ground red.\n\nIt’s charmingly brutal, with beautiful procedurally-generated islands and adorable soldiers juxtaposed against the blood-stained realities of war. You control the broad strokes of the battle, giving high level commands to your soldiers who try their best to carry them out in the heat of the moment. It’s accessibly deep, with simple player inputs masking a dynamic combat simulation that make it inviting to new players while challenging veterans.\n\nKeep fighting, warriors. Not for power or riches or glory, but for hope of peace to come once again in the harsh lands of the Bad North.\n\nKey Features\n\nREAL-TIME TACTICS ROGUELITE: Position and relocate your troops to fend off the Vikings, who each have their own counters to the threats you pose. Pick your battles and plan your evacuations carefully! Lose a commander and they’re gone forever lose everything, and it’s game over! \n\nINTELLIGENT UNIT CONTROLS: You command the broad strokes of your defences and monitor positioning — your soldiers do the rest, navigating and engaging intuitively in response to the situation at hand.\n\nPROCEDURALLY-GENERATED ISLANDS: Each island is both stylistically charming and unique in its layout. Plan your strategies around every nook and cranny, for you only get one chance to save them from the enemy invasion.\n\nUNLOCKABLE UPGRADES: A stronger, smarter defence leads to greater rewards. Use these to develop your subjects from a ragtag militia into seasoned warriors.",

One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero’s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease.\n\nThe hero travels through many levels including a forest, a cemetery, a battlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own alternative reality versions slightly different versions that hold a few more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero’s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets. \n\nA mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there’s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality. In some cases the hero can even create a clone of himself! \n\nBy using all of your abilities and finding your way through the different realities you may yet find lady death.\n\nFEATURES: - Unique gameplay due to alternative reality levels and time warp feature - Varied game mechanics - Grayscale graphic with original “old horror” camera effects - Enigmatic story reminiscent of dark fairy tales - Beautiful minimal soundtrack - 21 levels full of disturbing story",

But you can keep collecting and saving up money to go 'shopping' to increase your life and carefully select powered-up weapons to take down enemies you couldn't defeat before. The further you get, the stronger you can feel yourself becoming - and it feels good.\n\nThe characters appearing in between stages are the game's other charm point. You'll meet your co-worker, who is a cat (for some reason), your president (also a cat), and an office lady of indeterminate species. They work like us, slog through overtime like us, whinge, get berated, and even comfort each other, just like us.\n\nExperience the unique and intricately detailed world of Kero Blaster!",

After spending three years in jail, you just want to live an honest life and recover your daughter. However, the quirky clients of The Box will drive you closer to your turbulent past, involving you in a gangster scheme that threatens to destroy everything that you love.\n\nEvery night, among the club’s visitors, you’ll find undercover cops, annoying celebrities, runaway criminals or ghosts from your past. As the new gatekeeper of The Box, you decide who enters and who doesn’t... by any means necessary. Be careful though, because each choice you make can influence the fate of the club and its clients. You’ll also need to keep your salary to avoid being evicted, to see your daughter again, and most importantly, to regain control of your life.  Will you let teenagers into the club in exchange for money? Will you confront a wealthy client to save his girlfriend when she asks you for help? Or will you work with the police to bring down the most powerful gangster in town?\n\nEveryone’s lives are in your hands. Only you choose how their stories end.  Key Features\n\nRace against the clock as you manage the crowded line of The Box, where you’ll interact with more than 300 unique characters, each one with their own hidden particularities that you will have to discover.  As head of security at The Box, you’ll have to: - Follow the club’s rules, which become more complex with every day that passes. - Find out who is lying and who is telling the truth. - Who knows: you might even have to throw a punch or two!  Not every day is the same: - Be careful who you don’t let in. Maybe their significant other is a big fish, or the rest of their group might decide to go to another club. - Dealing with VIPs won’t be easy. They expect the royal treatment. - Beware of the people that enter the club. If you let rock fans in during an elite party, they may wreak havoc! - The Box also organizes special events like St. Patrick’s, a day where everyone can get drunk and enter the club!\n\nExperience different storylines depending on your choices: - Will you flirt with your boss’ girlfriend? - Will you work with the police? - Will you get along with a powerful but annoying gangster?

Despite humanity's best efforts, the alien invaders superior technology proved too much to overcome and they took over most of the planet.  With enemy forces at the gates of the last fortress of the EDC and the fate of the planet hanging in the balance, the leaders of Earth's forces decide on a desperate course of action: throw everything they had left at the enemy's headquarters. With the help of the erratically brilliant \"Dr. AKEMI,\" the goal is no less than the destruction of the very heart of the alien stronghold.\n\nFeatures of Quad Fighter K include:\n\n- It's Dangerous to Go Alone The alien forces are an overwhelming force, but one you don't have to face alone.

Unlock different attacks by connecting your ship with your allies.\n\n- Should I Stay or Should I Go?

Only the most skilled and strategic players will defeat the Trial of the Gods.\n\nYou are a Faceless One: a one-armed, gun-wielding assassin of legend. The seven deities of Polygod will test your skill with randomly generated arenas of hostile minions, followed by a boss fight against a ruthless Holy Champion.\n\nEach of the arenas features five Altars of Worship, offering you Blessings in exchange for Souls you have collected along your journey. Blessings combine and stack to create unique gun effects, but each has consequences, so choose wisely if you wish to survive each wicked challenge. And don’t forget, death is permanent in this purgatory of the gods!\n\nThe art style is inspired by the meta-physical surrealist artist Giorgio de Chirico who is famously revered for his eerie mood and strange artificiality of cityscapes.\n\nMain Features: A unique, randomly generated experience every time. Randomise the levels, blessings offered and enemy placement with our seed system, or challenge others on specific seeds!\n\nGun customisation with 100 unique blessings. Each seed will offer you a different selection of blessings as you progress through the levels. Strategically combine and stack them to fit your personal playstyle. Ever wondered what it would be like if your bullets were bubbles? Well, what if they were bubbles AND proximity mines? And you shot 3 of them at once? AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT? The options are endless! Do you choose a lethal sniper build, or a bullet wall of death? How will you survive: lifesteal, jump-strafe dodging, tank-like health? How do you want to navigate the environment: double jump, helicopter boots, teleportation?\n\nAdditional Features: Splitscreen co-op Gyroscope aiming supported 35 unique enemies 15 unlockable playable characters 7 epic boss fights against Holy Champions 7 even harder Red Holy Champions Special Boss Blessings Experimental soundtrack Minimalist, colourful artstyle Quirky NPCs",
